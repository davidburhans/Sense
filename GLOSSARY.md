Head - The main part of *Sensé*. This contains the means to translate *Senses* into *Sensations* and orchastrates all of the communication between *Senses* and the *User*. The *Head* also contains default *Senses* depending on the model.

SkullSaw - The web-based tool that is used to: 
* Configuration of *Senses* and *Sensations*.
* Control which *Senses* are translated into which *Sensations*.
* "Simulate" *Senses* in a way which encourages learning.
* Loads new configurations into the *Head*.

Sensation - A device that communicates with the *Head* to notify a user of the activation of a *Sense*. *Sensations* can vary in how they notify the user and can even have distinct notification mechanisms depending on the *Sensory Data* and the *Sense*. Specifically, a first-generation *Sensation* is a wearable group of tiny, vibration motors which is able to wirelessly communicate data from the *Head* to the *User*.

Sensational Data - The output from the *Head* for a *Sensation*.

Sense - A sensor device that generates *Sensory Data* and communicates with the *Head* in order to deliver input to *Sensé*. This *Sensory Data* is translated and passed to a *Sensation* to inform the *User*.

Sensé - A product that gives its *User* the perception of extra *Senses* through wearable *Sensations*.

Sensory Data - The input for the *Head* generated by a *Sense*.

User - The individual that is wearing *Sensé* -- the *Head*, *Sensations*, and optionally add-on *Senses*.
